# p5 Sketches

## 001

* [001](./001/)

Test sketch to get to grips with p5.js basics. Draws a bunch of circles on the
screen at the mouse position.

## Delaunay Triangulation

* [002-delaunay-triangulation](./002-delaunay-triangulation/)

Calculate and draw the Delaunay triangulation for a bunch of random points. The
code's pretty ugly (this will be a common theme), but I'm happy with it
nonetheless, mostly because I figured out how to create a basic triangle mesh
structure.

## Colour Snake

* [003-colour-snake](./003-colour-snake/)

Create crazy spirograph-like patterns by bouncing a coloured ball around the
screen, with multiple copies rotated around the centre of the screen.
