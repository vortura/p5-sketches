# p5 Sketches

A bunch of p5.js sketches for fun. Browse the repository at
https://vortura.github.io/p5-sketches/.

## 001

* [001](./001/)

Test sketch to get to grips with p5.js basics. Draws a bunch of circles on the
screen at the mouse position.

## Delaunay Triangulation

* [002-delaunay-triangulation](./002-delaunay-triangulation/)

Calculate and draw the Delaunay triangulation for a bunch of random points. The
code's pretty ugly (this will be a common theme), but I'm happy with it
nonetheless, mostly because I figured out how to create a basic triangle mesh
structure.

## Colour Snake

* [003-colour-snake](./003-colour-snake/)

Create crazy spirograph-like patterns by bouncing a coloured ball around the
screen, with multiple copies rotated around the centre of the screen.

## Random Walk

* [004-random-walk](./004-random-walk/)

Trace the random walk of 10 particles.

## Lindenmayer System Test

* [005-l-system-1](./005-l-system-1/)

L-system test sketch. OK, so there's not much to look at with this one. If you
open the javascript console you can see the output of several iterations of
a simple L-System that simulates algae growth.

## Pythagoras Tree

* [006-l-system-pythagoras-tree](./006-l-system-pythagoras-tree/)

L-System to generate a Pythagoras Tree.

## Kantor Set

* [007-cantor-set](./007-cantor-set/)

L-System to generate a Kantor set.

## Koch Curve

* [008-koch-curve](./008-koch-curve/)

L-System to generate a Koch set.

## Sierpinski Triangle

* [009-sierpinski-triangle](./009-sierpinski-triangle/)

L-System to generate a Sierpinski triangle.

## Sierpinski Arrowhead

* [010-sierpinski-arrowhead](./010-sierpinski-arrowhead/)

Approximate a Sierpinski triangle with a Sierpinski arrowhead curve L-System.
